                    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>The Program Administrator may collect and use personal information about clients and consumers in order to provide products or services. We believe that this personal information must be protected. We are committed to respecting personal information and using it only as appropriate to provide you with the best service. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>

                    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>We may collect and use personal information about clients and consumers. We collect personal information when you interact with us. For example, when you: file a request for benefits or a claim on our website; request more information on our website to become a prospective business partner; complete an application or other form; contact us for customer service or other assistance; engage in a purchase transaction; or submit personal information to us. The personal information we collect may include: first and last name, email address, physical address, phone number(s), financial institution account information, credit/debit card information, vehicle information, and vehicle insurance information. We may receive personal information from other sources, such as consumer reporting agencies and motor vehicle reports. We may record phone calls made to our offices for training and quality assurance purposes. We may use video surveillance on our premises.</p>
                    <p>When you use our website we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate your use of our website. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. The cookies make your use of the website easier, make the website run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure website. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our website may not work properly in that case. Also, we may obtain your internet protocol address, computer’s operating system, and browser type; the website address of a referral website; and the path you take on our web pages.</p>

                    <h3>Sharing Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent personal information. We do provide some of our products services through contractual arrangements with service providers, affiliates and agents, and other third parties (collectively “service partners”.) Service partners are only allowed to use personal information for those services we ask them to perform. We and our service partners use personal information to operate our web sites and deliver products and services. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.</p>
                    <p>We may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal information to governmental authorities. We will disclose personal information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our products services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may share statistical data that does not identify you with service partners and government regulators.</p>

                    <h3>Safeguarding Your Information</h3>
                    <p>We secure personal information consistent with current industry standards. Personal information is protected in several ways. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. We restrict access to personal information to those employees who need to know in order to provide services. The Program Administrator’s Confidentiality Policy, which applies to all employees, restricts the use of all personal information and requires the utmost discretion.</p>
                    <p>On our website, we have installed usernames, passwords and other safety features to ensure that personal information remains secure. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, personal information resides on a secure server that only selected employees and contractors have access to via password.</p>
                    <p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit/debit card and checking/savings account transactions are handled completely by service partners that are established third party lending, processing agents and distribution institutions. They request, obtain and receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process purchases.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
                    <p>Questions regarding privacy should be directed to the Program Administrator by sending an e-mail to sales@myameriplus.com or writing to us at the following address: Program Administrator, 1785 Hancock Street, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92110. San Diego, CA 92110-2051</p>
